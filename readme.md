Design a class structure for a library management system
You should have at least 3 entities
User
Book
Author
Role (optional if you like it to be a bit more complicated)
Category (optional)
and other stuff (let me know if you are interested)
you should approach it this way
You have a library where the User (as admin) can create books/authors (add them to the library)
The user (as admin) can also edit, update, or delete books/authors
The user (as a normal user) can only get the book by id or ISBN
borrow a book
